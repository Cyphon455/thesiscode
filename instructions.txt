- A DATA_PATH environment variable pointing to the input data (pickle file) is required
- Unpack data.rar for the input data file
- Input data needs to be a list of dictionaries, each row with a 'column: value' format

- Use main.py for the main system
- comparison.py is for the base PI system
- baseline.py is for queries without indexing

- Sampling size and indexing style can be set in main.py
- Predicates and queries are set in dev.py -> QuerySimulator.simulate()
